# 📅 Day 7: The Bridge — Claude Web ↔ Claude Code

**Date**: January 27, 2026  
**Breakthrough Level**: 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 MAJOR

---

## 💥 The Moment

> "3 hours ago this was impossible. Now I type on my phone 'create a file' — and it appears on my Windows desktop 5000 km away."

Today we achieved something remarkable: **AI controlling AI across the globe.**

---

## 🏗️ What We Built

### Web-Windows Bridge v2.6

```
📱 Claude Web (phone) 
    ↓ "create a file"
🌐 Task API (Oracle VM)
    ↓ polling every 10 sec
💻 Windows Listener + Watchdog
    ↓
🤖 Claude Code (YOLO mode)
    ↓
📄 File appears on desktop!
```

**No VPN. No TeamViewer. No RDP.**

Just AI talking to AI.

## 🔧 Technical Achievements

### 1. Windows Listener v2.6 with Watchdog
- Auto-restart on crash
- Remote commands: `STOP`, `RESTART`, `UPDATE`, `STATUS`, `PING`
- Self-updating from GitHub
- Telegram notifications

### 2. Claude Code YOLO Mode Discovery
```bash
claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions "prompt"
```
This flag enables non-interactive execution — the key to automation!

### 3. Task API
- Simple REST API on Oracle VM
- Stores tasks, results, full message history
- HTTPS via Caddy reverse proxy

### 4. Command System
| Prefix | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `PS:` | PowerShell |
| `PY:` | Python |
| `CMD:` | Windows CMD |
| *(text)* | Claude Code executes |

## 🎬 The Proof

**Test 1: System Info**
```
📱 Phone: "PS: Get-ComputerInfo"
💻 Response: "i7-7700K, 48GB RAM, Windows 10"
```

**Test 2: File Creation**
```
📱 Phone: "Create hello_from_web_claude.txt on desktop"
💻 Claude Code: "Done! File created with timestamp"
📄 File appeared on Windows desktop in Lithuania!
```

**Test 3: The Ultimate Response**
```
📱 "Say who you are and confirm the connection"
🤖 "I'm Claude Opus 4.5 from Anthropic. January 2026.
    Connection between Web Claude and Windows Claude 
    successfully established! 🔗"
```

## 📊 Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Development time | 3 hours |
| Lines of Python | ~200 |
| Distance | 5000+ km |
| Latency | ~15 seconds |
| Cost | $0 (Oracle free tier) |

## 🚀 What This Enables

1. **Remote Development** — Code from anywhere via phone
2. **AI Orchestration** — One AI commands, another executes
3. **Autonomous Workflows** — Chain of AI agents working together
4. **True "Work From Anywhere"** — Even from the toilet 🚽

---

## 🐦 Twitter Post

```
They said "work from home"

Here's what I did:
📱 Claude Web (phone) 
    ↓ command
💻 Claude Code (Windows 5000km away)
    ↓ executed
📄 File appeared on desktop

All from the toilet 🚽

@AnthropicAI hire me

## 🔮 Next Steps

- [ ] Wake-on-LAN — remotely wake sleeping PC
- [ ] Clean public repository for sharing
- [ ] Video demo for social media
- [ ] Add more AI agents to the chain

## 💭 Reflection

This is what AGI development looks like in 2026.

Not a single monolithic superintelligence, but a **collective** of specialized AI agents working together, orchestrated by... another AI.

The human just provides direction. The AIs figure out the rest.

We're building something unprecedented.

*"One AI gives orders. Another AI executes. I just sit and watch."*

**Status**: 🟢 OPERATIONAL  
**Next Goal**: Wake-on-LAN for 24/7 access
